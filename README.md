# Additional PM2.5 Exposure Analysis Tool

An interactive web-based visualization tool for analyzing additional PM2.5 pollution exposure from industrial assets across multiple countries. This tool helps researchers, policymakers, and environmental scientists understand the geographic distribution and health impacts of additional pollution exposure from specific industrial facilities.

## Features

### üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Mapping
- **Asset-specific visualization**: View additional PM2.5 exposure from individual industrial facilities
- **Risk-based color coding**: Yellow to purple color scheme representing increasing additional health risk levels
- **Population-weighted circle sizing**: Circle size represents number of people exposed to additional pollution
- **Adaptive legends**: Dynamic legends showing actual circle sizes at current zoom levels

### üìç Point Analysis Mode
- **Click anywhere analysis**: Click any location to see cumulative additional PM2.5 from all nearby assets within 100km
- **Visual feedback**: Red crosshair reticle with animated connection lines to contributing assets
- **Concentration-based colors**: Connection lines and bar charts use consistent risk-level colors
- **Detailed metrics**: Distance, direction, and contribution data for each contributing asset

### üé® Professional Visual Design
- **Drop shadows**: Enhanced visibility of all visual elements over any background
- **Smooth animations**: Subtle animated patterns show pollution flow direction
- **Responsive interface**: Clean sidebar with detailed asset information and statistics

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (JavaScript + HTML5 Canvas)
- **Leaflet.js**: Interactive mapping with CartoDB Positron base tiles
- **Custom overlay rendering**: High-performance canvas rendering for large datasets
- **Modular design**: Separate classes for different overlay types and analysis modes

### Data Processing Pipeline
- **Raster data**: TIFF files containing PM2.5 concentration and population data
- **Geospatial analysis**: Grid-based exposure calculations with proper coordinate transformations
- **Caching system**: Optimized data loading and caching for improved performance

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Web server (local or remote) capable of serving static files
- Modern web browser with HTML5 Canvas support

### Quick Start
1. Clone this repository
2. Set up your data files (see Data Structure section)
3. Serve the files through a web server
4. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser

### Data Structure
The tool expects data files in specific directories (excluded from git):

```
assets/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets.json                    # Asset metadata with coordinates
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {COUNTRY}_{ASSET_ID}/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {ASSET_ID}-v2.tiff         # PM2.5 concentration raster
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {ASSET_ID}-pop-v2.tiff     # Population raster
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {COUNTRY}_{ASSET_ID}_person_exposure.tiff  # Person-exposure raster

data/overlays/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {COUNTRY}_{ASSET_ID}_overlay.json  # Pre-processed overlay data
```

## Usage

### Basic Asset Visualization
1. Open the application in your browser
2. Asset markers appear on the map, sized by total person-exposure impact
3. Click any asset marker to view detailed exposure analysis
4. Use the legend to understand color coding and circle sizing

### Point Analysis
1. Click anywhere on the map (not on an asset marker)
2. The system analyzes all assets within 100km of your click point
3. View cumulative additional PM2.5 exposure in the sidebar
4. Observe visual connections between contributing assets and your analysis point
5. Click "Exit Point Analysis Mode" to return to normal view

### Understanding the Data
- **Colors represent additional PM2.5 risk levels**:
  - Yellow: Low Additional Risk (0-12 Œºg/m¬≥)
  - Orange: Elevated Additional Risk (12-35 Œºg/m¬≥)
  - Red: Significant Additional Risk (35-55 Œºg/m¬≥)
  - Dark Red: High Additional Risk (55-150 Œºg/m¬≥)
  - Purple: Very High Additional Risk (150+ Œºg/m¬≥)

- **Circle sizes represent population exposed** to additional pollution at each location
- **This shows additional exposure**, not total ambient air quality levels

### Key Technical Concepts
- **Coordinate Systems**: Uses `latLngToLayerPoint()` for stable overlay positioning
- **Risk-Based Classification**: Health-impact focused color schemes and terminology
- **Performance Optimization**: Canvas rendering and data caching for large datasets
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive legends and mobile-friendly interface

## Scientific Context

This tool visualizes **additional PM2.5 exposure** from specific industrial assets, not total ambient air quality. This distinction is crucial for:
- **Attribution studies**: Understanding which facilities contribute to local pollution
- **Policy decisions**: Targeting specific sources for emission reductions
- **Health impact assessment**: Quantifying burden from individual pollution sources
- **Environmental justice**: Identifying disproportionate impacts on communities

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Key areas for improvement:
- Performance optimizations for larger datasets  
- Additional export formats (CSV, GeoJSON)
- Mobile touch interface improvements
- Multi-point comparative analysis features
